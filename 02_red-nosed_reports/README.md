# Red-nosed Reports

`Sample pseudocode`

## Part 1

- Conform individual rows as a list/vector/array
- Set a flag for demarkation of results, maybe a counter
- Iterate over indexes in the collection
- For each element, get the element following it 
- Subtract the two and compare the absolute value with the bounds
- Update flag accordingly
